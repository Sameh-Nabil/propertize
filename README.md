This Solidity smart contract allows property owners to tokenize their real estate properties and sell or rent them on the blockchain.

## Features
- Tokenizes real estate properties
- Enables buying and selling of properties using cryptocurrency
- Enables renting of properties with periodic payments
- Uses an approval process to ensure the authenticity and ownership of the properties
- Includes a test suite to ensure the functionality of the contract

## Usage
To use this contract, you'll need to deploy it on the Ethereum network using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using a web3 provider like MetaMask.

The following functions are available on the contract:

- `mintProperty`: Tokenizes a new property and mints tokens that represent its ownership.
- `listForSale`: Lists a property for sale and sets its sale price.
- `buyProperty`: Allows a buyer to purchase a property by transferring cryptocurrency to the seller.
- `listForRent`: Lists a property for rent and sets its rent price and period.

- `getProperty`: Returns the details of a property by its ID.
